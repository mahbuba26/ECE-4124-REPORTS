 1. [Convolution of 2 signals using conv function and without using conv function.](https://github.com/mahbuba26/ECE-4124-REPORTS/blob/main/ECE_4124%20LAB%201/ECE%204124_LAB1%20markdown/ECE%204124_LAB1.md)
 2. Perform the following task: -
          a. Circular convolution of 2 signals.
          b. Sum and subtraction of 2 signals and show them in a figure.
          c. Perform 2 types of trapezoid signal.
3. Correlation of 2 signals using function and without using function.
4. Correlation of a signal with its delayed function and find the x ordinate value.
5. Study of Causal, Non-causal and Anti causal Signals.
